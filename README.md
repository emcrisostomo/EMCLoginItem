EMCLoginItem
============

`EMCLoginItem` is an Objective-C library to query, add and remove login items
in Apple OS X.

Usage
-----

An instance of `EMCLoginItem` can be created using either one of the provided
`init` methods or one of the provided factory methods (`loginItem*`).  These
methods have the following method signatures:

  * `- (instancetype)init;`
  * `- (instancetype)initWithBundle:(NSBundle *)bundle;`
  * `- (instancetype)initWithPath:(NSString *)path;`

When the initialiser with no argument is used, the bundle path of the main
bundle is used as login item URL:

    [[NSBundle mainBundle] bundlePath];

Alternatively, the other two initialisers can be used to manually provide
either a bundle or a path to use as login item URL.

The methods implemented by the `EMCLoginItem` class are the following:

  * `- (BOOL)isLoginItem;`
  * `- (void)addLoginItem;`
  * `- (void)removeLoginItem;`
  * `- (void)addAfterLast;`
  * `- (void)addAfterFirst;`
  * `- (void)addAfterItemWithPath:(NSString *)path;`
  * `- (void)addAfterBundle:(NSBundle *)bundle;`
  * `- (void)setIconRef:(IconRef)iconRef;`

The first three methods are used to respectively query, add and remove a login
item for the current user with the specified URL, as show in the following
example:

    if (![loginItem isLoginItem])
    {
      [loginItem addLoginItem];
    }

The `addAfter*` methods let callers specify the position where the login item
will be added:

  * `addAfterLast` will add the login item at the end of the item list.
  * `addAfterFirst` will add the login item at the beginning of the item list.
  * `addAfterItemWithPath` will add the login item after the item with the
    specified path, if it exists, otherwise at the end of the item list.
  * `addAfterBundle` will add the login item after the item with the
    specified bundle, if it exists, otherwise at the end of the item list.

The `setIconRef` path is used to pass an `IconRef` instance to be used as a
custom icon for the login item to be added.  This method increases the IconRef
reference count by 1 invoking the `AcquireIconRef` method if and only if the
value to be set differs from the currently stored value (initially nil, and
released if not nil).  The `dealloc` method takes care of releasing non-null
IconRef references invoking the `ReleaseIconRef` method.

Prerequisites
-------------

This library requires [ARC][arc] (_Automatic Reference Counting_) and
compilation will fail if ARC support is not available.

Installation with CocoaPods
---------------------------

`EMCLoginItem` is also available through [CocoaPods][cocoapods] and a
dependency to it can be added to your Podfile:

    pod 'EMCLoginItem', '~> 1.0'

[cocoapods]: http://cocoapods.org

Installation
------------

`EMCLoginItem` is packaged and distributed as a _framework_.  Developers who
want to compile it from source may either use Xcode (a project called
`EMCLoginItem.xcodeproj` is included in the sources) or `xcodebuild`.  Once the
framework is installed it can be referenced and linked from any other Xcode
project.

The best place to install public frameworks is in `/Library/Frameworks` since
frameworks in that location are discovered automatically by the compiler and
the dynamic linker (see Apple's [_Framework Programming Guide_][fmk]).

[fmk]: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/macosx/conceptual/BPFrameworks/Tasks/InstallingFrameworks.html

The easiest way to install or upgrade an installation of `EMCLoginItem` in
`/Library/Framework` is using `xcodebuild` specifying `/` as `DSTROOT`:

    $ sudo xcodebuild install DSTROOT=/

Alternatively, you can install the framework using a binary package you can
download for every release.

Please beware that since the package is _not_
signed, you will have to temporarily allow installation for applications
downloaded from _Anywhere_ in the _Security & Privay_ section in
_System Preferences_.
